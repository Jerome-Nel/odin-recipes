    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Baked chicken wings are so easy to make, and they come out of the oven crispy and delicious. There's no need for flour!</p>
    <p>Simply bake them in a 400Â°F oven for 40 minutes. And if you want them extra-crispy, leave them in a warm oven for 30-60 more minutes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, pressed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>10 chicken wings</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine the olive oil, garlic, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a large, resealable bag; seal and shake to combine. Add the chicken wings; reseal and shake to coat. Arrange the chicken wings on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Cook the wings in the preheated oven 1 hour, or until crisp and cooked through.</li>
    </ol>
