        <h1 class="left">Tuskan Fish Stew</h1>
        <div class="recipe-desc">
            <p>This traditional fisherman's stew from the port town of Livorno in Tuscany is a seafood-lover's dream! Packed with octopus, squid, mussels, clams and langoustines as well as whatever fish is available on the day, this is a seriously flavourful stew. Serve it over toasted bread rubbed with garlic like the locals do.</p>
            <p>Simply bake them in a 400°F oven for 40 minutes. And if you want them extra-crispy, leave them in a warm oven for 30-60 more minutes.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Puree cherry tomatoes and clam juice in a blender until smooth. Press mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl.</li>
                <li>Combine 3 tablespoons olive oil, green onions, garlic, anchovy, and 1 pinch red pepper flakes in a cold plan. Place over medium heat. Cook and stir until garlic and onions just start to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato mixture. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer stew until color deepens, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add halibut and shrimp to the stew. Season with salt. Increase heat to high. Cover pan and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes. Stir in parsley, basil, oregano, and rosemary. Pour stew into a warm bowl. Drizzle in remaining olive oil and sprinkle 1 pinch red pepper flakes on top. Serve with crusty bread.</li>
